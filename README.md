nLab software
=============

The software underlying the [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) is a heavily modified fork of [Instiki](https://github.com/parasew/instiki). The code is moving further and further away from the original Instiki, and the plan (hopefully by the end of 2019) is to have evolved to what is essentially an entirely distinct codebase, no longer a fork.

Local development
=================

The nLab is currently not well suited to developing locally. This will change with the move to a distinct codebase. If you are interested in working on something, get in touch with Richard Williamson, who will be happy to suggest tasks or provide suggestions for how to work locally on something.

Joining in
==========

All help is very welcome! Just send an email to Richard Williamson (richard (at) rwilliamson-mathematics.info) or Urs Schreiber (urs.schreiber (at) gmail.com) to express your interest, and we'll take it from there.
